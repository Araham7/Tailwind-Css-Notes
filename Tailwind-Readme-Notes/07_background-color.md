# Background Colorm :
In Tailwind CSS, background colors are defined using the `bg-` utility class. This utility allows you to apply various colors to an element's background using predefined color palettes. Tailwind provides an extensive set of colors and shades, allowing for precise customization.

## Syntax :
```tailwind
bg-{color}-{shade}
```

- `color:` The base color (e.g., `red`, `blue`, `green`, `gray`).
- `shade:` The intensity of the color, usually between `50(lightest)` and `900(darkest)`.
